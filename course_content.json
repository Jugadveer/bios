This means it is a widely accepted intermediary used in transactions to buy goods and services. Before money, societies relied on the **barter system**, which required a 'double coincidence of wants'. Money eliminates this problem by providing a universally accepted medium."

By assigning a currency value (e.g., $10$ or ₹$100$), money allows for easy comparison, calculation of profit/loss, and budget formulation."

Wealth is a broader term that refers to the total stock of valuable assets owned by an individual or entity, which includes money but also investments, real estate, and other durable goods.",

                "answer": "Yes, it is. If everyone agrees to quote the price of goods in terms of the weight or unit of gold (e.g., 'that cow costs 5 ounces of gold'), then gold is successfully acting as a Unit of Account, providing a common standard for measuring value.",

                "answer": "If your needs exceed 50%, your budget is unbalanced. You need to either increase your income or reduce your cost of living. Focus first on high-cost needs like housing and transportation, as these offer the biggest opportunities for cuts (e.g., finding a cheaper apartment or reducing car reliance).",

Investing involves placing money into assets (stocks, mutual funds) with the expectation of higher growth over the long term, accepting greater risk for greater potential returns.",
