    "question": "Why is 'tax-deferred' growth better than fully taxable growth?",
    "answer": "With tax-deferred growth, the capital that would have been paid as tax is kept invested, allowing it to continue earning returns and compounding until retirement. This dramatically increases the final corpus.",
    "explanation": "You get to invest the government's money (the tax owed) for decades, earning returns on it until you eventually pay the tax later."

    "question": "If I receive a dividend, is it a Capital Gain or taxable Income?",
    "answer": "Dividends are typically treated as taxable income in the year they are received. They are not Capital Gains, as they are not the result of selling the underlying asset.",
    "explanation": "Dividends are income; Capital Gains are profit from the sale of an asset. They are taxed differently."

    "question": "What is the major downside of withdrawing money from a typical retirement account early?",
    "answer": "Early withdrawal usually results in the immediate tax payment on the withdrawn amount *plus* a significant financial penalty (e.g., $10%$ of the withdrawn amount), making it very costly.",
    "explanation": "Retirement accounts are meant for retirement. The high penalties are designed to discourage using these funds early."
