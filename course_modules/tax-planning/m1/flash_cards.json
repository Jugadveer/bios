    "theory_content": "A **Capital Gain** is the profit you make from selling an investment (stock, house, fund) for more than you paid for it. This profit is subject to tax. Gains are typically classified as **Short-Term** (held for less than 1 year) or **Long-Term** (held for more than 1 year), with long-term gains usually taxed at a lower rate to incentivize holding periods."
