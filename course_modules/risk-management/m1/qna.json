    "question": "How does diversification mitigate risk that is *not* systematic?",
    "answer": "Diversification reduces unsystematic risk because it assumes the negative event affecting one company (e.g., poor earnings) is independent of the positive event affecting another company in a different sector, smoothing out the returns.",
    "explanation": "Spreading money across multiple, uncorrelated companies means one failure won't sink the entire portfolio."

    "question": "What is 'Liquidity Risk'?",
    "answer": "Liquidity risk is the risk that you cannot sell an asset quickly enough at its fair market price to prevent a loss. It is high for assets like real estate or small, thinly traded stocks.",
    "explanation": "If you *need* to sell now, liquidity risk means you may have to accept a much lower price to find a buyer immediately."

    "question": "When should an investor use a mental stop-loss versus an automated stop-loss order?",
    "answer": "An automated stop-loss order is best for active traders. A mental stop-loss is better for long-term investors, as automated orders can be triggered by temporary market volatility, forcing the long-term investor to sell unnecessarily.",
    "explanation": "Automated stops prevent emotional panic, but they can force a sale at a bad time. Mental stops are for avoiding emotional panic but require discipline."
