    "question": "Why is real estate considered a good hedge against inflation?",
    "answer": "Real estate is considered an inflation hedge because as inflation rises, property values and rental income tend to rise as well, increasing the asset's nominal value and cash flow, which preserves the investor's purchasing power.",
    "explanation": "The income and value of the asset increase with the general cost of living."

    "question": "What is the key difference between a REIT and a real estate mutual fund?",
    "answer": "A REIT is a company that directly owns or finances property and trades on an exchange like a stock. A real estate mutual fund primarily invests in the *stocks and bonds* of real estate *companies*, not the physical property itself.",
    "explanation": "REITs are closer to direct ownership; mutual funds are indirect investment in the sector."

    "question": "What is negative leverage?",
    "answer": "Negative leverage occurs when the cost of borrowing (mortgage interest rate) is higher than the rate of return or appreciation generated by the property, leading to a net financial loss.",
    "explanation": "Leverage is only good if the asset's return exceeds the debt cost. Negative leverage means the debt is actively destroying wealth."
