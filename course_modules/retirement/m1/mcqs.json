      "correct": "Correct! The investor who starts earliest allows their money the maximum time to compound, which is usually the winning strategy.",
      "incorrect": "Time is the key ingredient. The 25-year-old has 15 extra years of compounding, which usually outweighs the higher contributions of the later starter."
