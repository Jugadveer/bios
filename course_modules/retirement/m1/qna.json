    "explanation": "You are not planning for today's cost of living, but the cost of living $30$ years from now. Inflation makes this number much larger."

    "question": "What is the primary risk associated with the $4%$ Rule?",
    "answer": "The primary risk is **Sequence of Returns Risk**. If a major market crash occurs during the first few years of retirement, the portfolio may be depleted too quickly, leading the fund to fail prematurely.",
    "explanation": "Early returns matter most. A big loss early on makes it very difficult for the portfolio to recover."
