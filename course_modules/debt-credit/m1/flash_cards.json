    "theory_title": "The Debt Accelerator",
    "theory_content": "**Simple interest** is calculated only on the principal amount. **Compound interest** (used by credit cards and many loans) is calculated on the principal *plus* the accumulated interest, causing the debt to grow exponentially. This makes high-interest compound debt extremely dangerous."

    "theory_content": "A **Credit Score** (e.g., CIBIL score) is a numerical summary of your creditworthiness, based on your payment history and debt management. Lenders use it to assess risk and determine interest rates. A higher score means lower interest rates on loans."

    "theory_content": "The biggest drivers of a credit score are: 1. **Payment History** (pay bills on time, always). 2. **Credit Utilization** (keep credit card balances low, ideally under $30%$ of the limit). 3. **Length of Credit History** (the older your accounts, the better)."
