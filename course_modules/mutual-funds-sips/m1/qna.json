    "explanation": "Active funds aim for outperformance, passive funds aim to match the market performance at the lowest possible cost."

    "question": "If the NAV of a fund is ₹100 and you invest ₹10,000, how many units do you get?",
    "answer": "You get 100 units ($\text{Investment} / \text{NAV} = \text{Units}$, so $\text{₹}10,000 / \text{₹}100 = 100 \text{ units}$).",
    "explanation": "This simple calculation shows how the total value of your investment is translated into ownership units of the fund."
