    "question": "What is the key takeaway of understanding market cycles for a long-term investor?",
    "answer": "The key takeaway is that bear markets (downtrends) are temporary and inevitable. A long-term investor should use the downturn as a buying opportunity (accumulation) and avoid panic-selling.",
