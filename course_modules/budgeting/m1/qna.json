    "question": "How do you apply the S.M.A.R.T. criteria to financial goal setting?",
    "answer": "S.M.A.R.T. stands for Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. For example, instead of saying 'Save more money,' a S.M.A.R.T. goal is: 'Save $5,000 for a down payment by December 31, 2026, by setting aside $200 per month.'",
    "explanation": "Using S.M.A.R.T. makes your goals actionable and trackable, dramatically increasing your chances of success. It turns a dream into a plan."

    "question": "If my 'Needs' (50%) category consistently exceeds 50% of my income, what should I do?",
    "answer": "If your needs exceed 50%, your budget is unbalanced. You need to either increase your income or reduce your cost of living. Focus first on high-cost needs like housing and transportation, as these offer the biggest opportunities for cuts (e.g., finding a cheaper apartment or reducing car reliance).",
    "explanation": "If your needs are too high, you have no financial margin. Reducing 'Needs' is a priority before cutting 'Wants' entirely."

    "question": "What is the difference between saving and investing within the 20% category?",
    "answer": "Saving involves setting aside money in highly liquid, low-risk accounts (like a high-yield savings account or Fixed Deposit) for short-term goals or emergencies. Investing involves placing money into assets (stocks, mutual funds) with the expectation of higher growth over the long term, accepting greater risk for greater potential returns.",
    "explanation": "Saving is for safety and liquidity; investing is for growth and beating inflation over time. Both are critical parts of the 20%."
