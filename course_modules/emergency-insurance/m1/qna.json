    "question": "When should I use my emergency fund?",
    "answer": "Use it only for true, unexpected emergencies: job loss, large deductible for a medical event, or an essential home/car repair. Do NOT use it for discretionary spending like vacations or splurges.",
    "explanation": "If it's predictable or optional, it's not an emergency. The fund is for disasters, not desires."
