    "theory_content": "A **stock** (or share/equity) represents fractional ownership in a publicly traded company. When you buy a stock, you become a shareholder, meaning you own a tiny piece of the company's assets and earnings. This is why stocks are also called 'equities'."

    "theory_content": "The **Primary Market** is where a company first sells shares to the public through an Initial Public Offering (IPO). The **Secondary Market** is where investors buy and sell existing shares among themselves (this happens on stock exchanges like the NSE or NYSE). Most day-to-day trading occurs in the Secondary Market."
