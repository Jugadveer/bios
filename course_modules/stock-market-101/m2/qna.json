    "question": "How do interest rates affect stock prices?",
    "answer": "Higher interest rates make borrowing more expensive for companies (hurting profits) and make fixed-income investments (like bonds) more attractive compared to stocks. This typically leads to a drop in stock prices.",
    "explanation": "Interest rates represent the 'risk-free' return. If rates rise, the hurdle for stocks to be competitive also rises."
