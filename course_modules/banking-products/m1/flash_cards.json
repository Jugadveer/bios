    "theory_content": "A Fixed Deposit (or Term Deposit) is a safe way to earn a fixed rate of interest for a set period. Your money is locked away until maturity, offering higher interest than a savings account. It's ideal for goals with a set time horizon (e.g., saving for a car in 3 years)."

    "theory_content": "A Recurring Deposit is a disciplined savings instrument where you commit to depositing a fixed amount every month for a set term. It also earns a fixed interest rate, often comparable to an FD, and is excellent for building capital incrementally for a specific goal."
