    "question": "What is the key advantage of a Fixed Deposit over a standard Savings Account?",
    "answer": "Fixed Deposits offer a guaranteed, higher rate of return than a typical savings account because the bank knows it can use your funds for a fixed period (i.e., you sacrifice liquidity for return).",
    "explanation": "FDs give you certainty: a guaranteed, higher interest rate that won't change, unlike variable savings rates."

    "question": "When comparing two savings accounts, what are the three most important factors to check?",
    "answer": "1. Interest Rate (the return you earn). 2. Fees and Charges (minimum balance, maintenance fees). 3. Deposit Insurance (safety guarantee).",

    "question": "If I withdraw my money from an FD early, what usually happens?",
    "answer": "Banks typically impose a penalty, which is usually a reduction in the interest rate earned or a flat fee, meaning you receive less than the initially promised interest.",
    "explanation": "The bank penalizes you for breaking the 'fixed' agreement, reducing the interest you earned to compensate for the early liquidity."
