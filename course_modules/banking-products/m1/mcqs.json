    "ai_feedback": {
      "correct": "Correct! A Savings Account offers the high liquidity necessary for an emergency fund.",
      "incorrect": "Incorrect. An emergency fund must be liquid. Fixed Deposits lock up money, making a Savings Account the better choice."

    "question": "The primary drawback of a Fixed Deposit compared to a Savings Account is:",
    "options": [
      "Lower interest rate.",
      "No deposit insurance.",
      "Low liquidity (penalties for early withdrawal).",
      "The interest rate is variable."
    ],
    "correct_answer": "Low liquidity (penalties for early withdrawal).",
    "ai_feedback": {
      "correct": "Exactly! FDs trade liquidity for a higher, fixed interest rate. Early withdrawal usually incurs a penalty.",
      "incorrect": "The main drawback is liquidity. While FDs offer higher interest, you face penalties if you need to withdraw the funds before the maturity date."

    "correct_answer": "Making systematic, disciplined monthly savings.",
    "ai_feedback": {
      "correct": "Nice! RDs enforce discipline by requiring a fixed monthly contribution, perfect for a specific, near-term goal.",
      "incorrect": "Try again. RDs are designed for disciplined saving by requiring a fixed monthly contribution, not for market investing."
