      "correct": "Nice, good job! A double coincidence of wants is the main challenge of a barter system, which money elegantly solves.",
      "incorrect": "Not quite. A barter system's main challenge is the 'Double Coincidence of Wants'—you both need to want what the other has. Money acts as a universal medium to fix this."

    "ai_feedback": {
      "correct": "That's right! When prices rise, the value stored in cash decreases, challenging its Store of Value function.",
      "incorrect": "Try again. Inflation, or the rising cost of goods, directly reduces what money can buy in the future, thus eroding its ability to function as a Store of Value."

    "correct_answer": "A generator of interest (Source of Return)",
    "ai_feedback": {
      "correct": "Exactly! Money itself does not generate returns; that's the job of investments. The three core functions are Unit of Account, Medium of Exchange, and Store of Value.",
      "incorrect": "Incorrect. The three core functions are Medium of Exchange, Unit of Account, and Store of Value. Generating interest is a characteristic of investments, not money itself."
