Wealth is a broader term that refers to the total stock of valuable assets owned by an individual or entity, which includes money but also investments, real estate, and other durable goods.",
    "explanation": "Wealth is the total picture of your assets; money is just the most liquid part of it."

    "question": "Why is 'portability' an important property for money?",
    "answer": "Portability is essential because money must be easily carried and transported to facilitate transactions across different locations. If money were not portable, its effectiveness as a medium of exchange would be severely limited.",
    "explanation": "Money needs to be easy to move around! Imagine trying to pay for coffee with a heavy gold bar—that's why portability is key."

    "question": "In a hypothetical scenario, if gold is used for trading, is it fulfilling the function of a Unit of Account?",
    "answer": "Yes, it is. If everyone agrees to quote the price of goods in terms of the weight or unit of gold (e.g., 'that cow costs 5 ounces of gold'), then gold is successfully acting as a Unit of Account, providing a common standard for measuring value.",
    "explanation": "The Unit of Account function is about the agreement on a standard measure, regardless of the physical form of the money (gold, shell, or fiat currency)."
