    "ai_feedback": {
      "correct": "You got it! Unsystematic risk—like a single stock performing poorly—is exactly what diversification is designed to offset.",
      "incorrect": "Incorrect. Diversification protects against unsystematic risk. You cannot diversify away systematic risk because it affects the entire market."

      "correct": "Exactly! The split between high-risk (stocks) and low-risk (bonds) assets dictates the portfolio's final risk and return trajectory.",
      "incorrect": "Asset allocation is about the mix of assets. This mix determines the *total* risk taken and, therefore, the long-term return potential."

    "ai_feedback": {
      "correct": "Nice job! Investing heavily in one area creates concentration risk, which is the opposite of diversification.",
