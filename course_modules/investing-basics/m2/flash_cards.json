    "theory_content": "The **Risk-Return Trade-off** is the principle that potential returns rise with an increase in risk. To achieve higher returns, an investor must typically accept a higher possibility of loss. Low-risk assets (like bank FDs) offer low returns, while high-risk assets (like individual stocks) offer the potential for high returns but also high losses.

    "theory_content": "In finance, risk is the uncertainty of an investment's return. It is often measured by **volatility** (how much an asset's price fluctuates). Higher volatility means higher risk. Examples of risk include market risk (the whole market falling) and credit risk (a borrower failing to pay debt)."

    "theory_title": "Risk Tolerance and Time Horizon",
    "theory_content": "Your acceptable risk level depends on two factors: **Risk Tolerance** (your emotional capacity to handle losses) and **Time Horizon** (how long until you need the money). Younger investors with a longer time horizon can generally afford to take on more risk because they have time to recover from market downturns."
